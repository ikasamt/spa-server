# spa-server

`spa-server` is a lightweight and flexible server written in Go to host Angular Single Page Applications (SPA). It supports serving static files from a `dist` directory, SPA routing, and configuration via a `.env` file. Docker support is included for easy deployment.

---

## Features

- **Static File Hosting**: Hosts files generated by `ng build`.
- **SPA Routing**: Routes all undefined paths to `index.html` for SPA compatibility.
- **Environment Configuration**: Configure port, static file directory, and IP restrictions via `.env`.
- **Docker Ready**: Easily build and deploy using Docker.

---

## Requirements

- Go 1.16+
- Angular CLI (for building the SPA)
- Docker (optional, for containerized deployment)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd spa-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Build the server:
   ```bash
   GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=0 go build -o bin/spa-server
   ```

---

## Usage

### Using the binary

1. Ensure your Angular app is built and the output is in the `dist` directory.

2. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```env
   PORT=8080
   DIST_DIR=./dist
   ALLOW_REMOTE_IPS=127.0.0.1,192.168.1.1
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   ./spa-server
   ```

4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:8080`.

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: The port to host the server. Defaults to `8080`.
- `DIST_DIR`: Path to the directory containing static files. Required.
- `ALLOW_REMOTE_IPS`: Comma-separated list of allowed IPs. Leave empty to allow all IPs.
